	    <h2>This page is here for banks in the UK who have branches to review, it will not remain here long.</h2>

	    <p>Hopefully you're here from your banks web site or data team, after having being given this link from your social media team. Please read the template email below, which I had hoped to email, but was told no email address was available.</p>

	    <h3>Branch location data</h3>

<p>
I am writing to you in the hope that you will help assist with the OpenStreetMap project, by providing an CSV File (Comma Separated Values File [.csv]) of all your branches you currently have within the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
OpenStreetMap, similar to Google Maps or Apple Maps, aims to maintain an accurate map of the world, with accurate data points for things like banks, shops, restaurants, etc. The difference is that OpenStreetMap is an "open" platform that allows anybody to edit the map (similar to Wikipedia for articles).
</p>
<p>
At the moment, OpenStreetMap (like other maps) likely has listings for your organisation that are either incorrect, out of date, or missing. Such things might include the wrong opening hours, the wrong address data, or the fact that a branch has since closed.
</p>
<p>
This past data will have been obtained from local people visiting the location and noting the location, address, and office hours which are usually attached to the branch.
</p>
<p>
To help maintain accurate branch location data for your organisation on OpenStreetMap, I would like to ask you to consider, on a regular (real time / weekly / monthly) basis, to release a full list of your current branch locations and office hours, in a CSV format, so that editors of OpenStreetMap are able to check against a known up to date list of your branches to ensure they remain accurate.
</p>
<p>
By making available a regular up to date list in a computerised format, OpenStreetMap editors can quickly and easily see if branch data has changed over time (such as different office hours) and update the map accordingly.
</p>
<p>
This request was initially sent to TSB (<a href="tsb-query.htm">tsb-query</a>) as after a de-merger from Lloyds, it left OpenStreetMap with a large amount of out of date markers that today still remain as LloydsTSB (<a href="https://osm.mathmos.net/ghosts/lloyds-tsb/">shown here</a>) - over 60 locations are currently marked up incorrectly as LloydsTSB.
</p>
<p>
Another problem is many HSBC's, which has since re-branded as HSBC UK in the UK, is still marked with the old branding, <a href="https://osm.mathmos.net/ghosts/hsbc/">seen here</a>.
</p>
<p>
If possible, under your "branch location" page, placing a link on this page to a "download" link for the CSV file would be the simplest way of making this list available, with a note of when the file was last updated.
</p>
<p>
This link would also need to be accompanied by a paragraph or two of text granting permission for the branch location data to be used by others for the purpose of maintaining accurate branch listings on third party platforms, meaning that people who wish to use it to update OpenStreetMap (or other listings) know that you have allowed this to occur.
</p>
<p>
The CSV list would need to contain the following values where possible, one per line for each branch:
<p>
BRANCH_CODE_ID,<br>
BRANCH_NAME,<br>
BRANCH_TYPE,<br>
BRANCH_ADDRESS_LINE_1,<br>
BRANCH_ADDRESS_LINE_2,<br>
BRANCH_ADDRESS_LINE_3,<br>
BRANCH_ADDRESS_LINE_TOWN-CITY,<br>
BRANCH_ADDRESS_LINE_COUNTY,<br>
BRANCH_ADDRESS_POSTCODE,<br>
BRANCH_LONGITUDE,<br>
BRANCH_LATITUDE,<br>
MONDAY_OPEN,<br>
MONDAY_CLOSE,<br>
TUESDAY_OPEN,<br>
TUESDAY_CLOSE,<br>
WEDNESDAY_OPEN,<br>
WEDNESDAY_CLOSE,<br>
THURSDAY_OPEN,<br>
THURSDAY_CLOSE,<br>
FRIDAY_OPEN,<br>
FRIDAY_CLOSE,<br>
SATURDAY_OPEN,<br>
SATURDAY_CLOSE,<br>
SUNDAY_OPEN,<br>
SUNDAY_CLOSE<br>
</p>
<p>
... it could also include other useful information that you feel is relevant and helpful, such as:
</p>
<p>
BRANCH_BRAND,<br>
BRANCH_ATM_INSIDE,<br>
BRANCH_ATM_OUTSIDE,<br>
BRANCH_PHONE,<br>
BRANCH_EMAIL,<br>
BRANCH_WEBSITE,<br>
BRANCH_MANAGER,<br>
BRANCH_WIFI,<br>
BRANCH_LUNCH_BREAK,<br>
BRANCH_OPENED_DATE,<br>
BRANCH_CLOSING_DATE,<br>
</p>
<p>
... where opened date was when the branch first opened, and closing date might be if the branch is set to close down.
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to participate in the regular release of up to date branch information, I feel it would greatly help with the accurate and up to date mapping of the United Kingdom by the many committed OpenStreetMap editors.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for at least taking the time to read this email.
</p>
<p>
Regards,
- Chris
